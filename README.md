# Catalogue of Peoples

Repository for the website, Catalogue of Peoples â€” an attempt to illustrate the rediscovery of our conscience that's manifesting in the global movement for the Palestinian Cause.

If not now, then never.

[TODO]: # "View the project at: [engineeringmorality.github.io/catalogueofpeoples](https://engineeringmorality.github.io/catalogueofpeoples)"

## Development

Thank you for your willingness to help.

### Adding more sources
This is the quickest way to contribute. Help add new sources that you come across to the public dataset: [`support-for-palestine.csv`](data/support-for-palestine.csv).

[TODO]: # "point to the new dataset repo after creating it instead"

Once you've created a GitHub account (perhaps throwaway), click the edit button in the file, continue to the file and add your new source(s). You'll then be prompted to create a "pull request" upon which your changes will be submitted for review.

Make sure the data (event's date and location) you're adding doesn't already exist in the dataset; further, duplicate work can also be avoided by checking if someone else has already proposed the same changes.

### Help by coding
If you're a developer, the technical README can be found [here](docs/development.md).

## Support
### Is there any other way I can support this?
If you have the privilege, fighting for the Palestinian cause is _the_ principal way to go about it; this project was born mostly because we didn't. 

More detailed resources (actions, charities, journalism, readings, and other initiatives) can be found at:

- [Palestine Resources Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sLUKG5HwKtFZZXaPOT3venMDq9PnJ_NM5dFzAhTRt_Q/):
  A product of the recent war on Palestine, maintained by [Dr. Fatima](https://www.youtube.com/@dr.fatima). The actions presented here, though more Western focused, should definitely be applicable for the most of us.

  *Privacy Warning (PW)[^1]*

- [Awesome Palestine (GitHub)](https://github.com/aborazmeh/awesome-palestine):
  A general consolidation of Palestine-related resources which takes a more community driven approach. Seems to be more diverse in resources and contributors.

[TODO]: # "add a trivialized summary?"

### How can I support similar projects?
If you'd like to make a financial contribution, can contact us [here](#contact).

In case you have the time and resources, we'd be delighted to have you join us (be it through open-source or privately too).

_Lastly, please don't hesitate to send any feedback, critical or otherwise, our way._

### Acknowledgements
This wouldn't have been possible without the many Palestinians who, until their last breath, bravely resisted occupation, and the many others who continue to do so. Not without those who're keeping the dream of the return to their land, and their home, very much alive.

The [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) and the great libraries born from this movement continue to aid the development of this project.

Finally, thanks to our supporter who provided the working space and the accessories necessary for this undertaking.
